# Intermediate Python Programming

This folder contains my notes and practice code from the Intermediate Python Programming course.

The content is based on the course taught by Patrick Loeber on the freeCodeCamp channel.

## Topics Covered

### Core Data Structures (Deep Dive)

* Lists (advanced operations, slicing, copying, list comprehension)
* Tuples (immutability, unpacking, performance comparison)
* Dictionaries (iteration, key handling, copying, error handling)
* Sets (union, intersection, difference, symmetric difference)
* Strings (formatting, splitting, joining, efficiency)

### Standard Library Modules

* collections (Counter, defaultdict, deque, namedtuple)
* itertools (product, permutations, combinations, accumulate, groupby)

### Functional & Error Handling

* Lambda functions
* map, filter, reduce
* Exceptions and custom exceptions
* try / except / else / finally

### Professional Practices

* Logging module (log levels, handlers, configuration)
* JSON handling (dump, load, custom encoding)
* Random module vs secrets vs NumPy random

### Advanced Concepts

* Decorators (with arguments, wraps, metadata preservation)
* Generators and yield
* Threading vs Multiprocessing
* Race conditions and locks
* Process pools

### Function Mechanics & Memory

* Function arguments (positional, keyword, *args, **kwargs)
* Asterisk (*) operator usage
* Shallow vs Deep Copy
* Context Managers (with statement, custom context managers)
