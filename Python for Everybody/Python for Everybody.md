## Purpose of This Directory

This directory is structured to:

* Strengthen backend programming fundamentals
* Understand how Python interacts with networks
* Learn API consumption and structured data handling
* Design relational databases properly
* Build end-to-end data pipelines
* Connect programming basics to real-world systems

The goal is not just to follow a tutorial, but to deeply understand the architecture and reasoning behind each concept.
