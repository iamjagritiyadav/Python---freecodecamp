# Repository Structure & Outline

This repository is organized to move from foundations to applied Data Science workflows.

## 01_Basics_Fundamentals

This section contains compressed but complete notes from the first 8 hours of the course.

The content is written from a **Data Science perspective**, not from a generic programming perspective.

It includes:

* Core programming logic required for data workflows
* Variables and data types in analytical context
* Boolean logic for filtering datasets
* Control flow for conditional transformations
* Functions for reusable data pipelines
* Modules and code organization
* Strings for text cleaning
* Lists, Tuples, Sets, Dictionaries for structured data handling

Purpose:
To ensure strong Python thinking before applying libraries like NumPy and Pandas.

---

## 02_NumPy

What it is:

* A high-performance numerical computing library built on C backend.

Why it exists:

* Python lists are inefficient for large-scale numerical operations.

Core Focus:

* ndarray structure
* Vectorization
* Broadcasting
* Aggregation functions

Goal:
Efficient numerical computation without explicit Python loops.

---

## 03_Pandas

What it is:

* A data manipulation and analysis library built on top of NumPy.

Why it exists:

* Real-world data is structured (tables), not raw arrays.

Core Focus:

* Series and DataFrame
* Reading CSV files
* Filtering and selection
* GroupBy operations
* Handling missing values

Goal:
Clean, transform, and structure datasets efficiently.

---

## 04_Data_Cleaning_&_Preprocessing

Focus Areas:

* Missing value treatment
* Duplicate removal
* Type conversion
* String cleaning
* Date-time handling
* Basic outlier awareness

Goal:
Prepare raw datasets for analysis and modeling.

---

## 05_Matplotlib

What it is:

* A foundational visualization library in Python.

Why it matters:

* Data without visualization is hard to interpret.

Core Focus:

* Line plots
* Bar charts
* Scatter plots
* Histograms
* Labels and legends

Goal:
Convert numerical analysis into interpretable visuals.

---

## 06_Seaborn

What it is:

* A statistical visualization library built on top of Matplotlib.

Why it matters:

* Cleaner, more informative statistical plots with less code.

Core Focus:

* Distribution plots
* Heatmaps
* Pairplots
* Correlation visualization

Goal:
Improve EDA efficiency and insight clarity.

---

## 07_Scikit-Learn

What it is:

* A machine learning library for modeling and evaluation.

Why it matters:

* After cleaning and exploring data, models are built for prediction.

Core Focus:

* Train-test split
* Basic regression and classification models
* Model evaluation metrics

Goal:
Understand the transition from data analysis to predictive modeling.

---

## 08_Exploratory_Data_Analysis (EDA)

Focus Areas:

* Summary statistics
* Distribution analysis
* Correlation understanding
* Trend detection
* Pattern identification

Goal:
Understand dataset behavior before modeling.

---

## 09_Feature_Engineering

Focus Areas:

* Creating derived columns
* Encoding categorical variables
* Aggregated features
* Date-based feature extraction
* Basic normalization awareness

Goal:
Transform raw variables into meaningful predictive features.

---

## End-to-End Project

### COVID-19 Trend Analysis Tool

This project integrates:

* NumPy for numerical operations
* Pandas for structured data handling
* Data cleaning pipeline
* Visualization using Matplotlib/Seaborn
* Insight extraction from time-series data

Outcome:
A structured, reproducible data analysis workflow using core Python Data Science libraries.
